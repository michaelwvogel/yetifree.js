# Yetifree.js

Yetifree is a modification of [**Dan Hough's Skifree.js**](https://github.com/basicallydan/skifree.js). Instead of being a skier who escapes a yeti, **you are the yeti**, and you must escape the murderous skier. Humans, amirite?

Skifree.js is a work-in-progress JavaScript port of the popular 1991 PC game [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/).
